# Autographe

## Overview

Autographe generates documentation for C# codebases.
It uses a process known as [Living Documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEV-tEmfnOM&pp=ygUYbGl2aW5nIGRvY3VtZW50YXRpb24gbmRj). 
A model of the consuming C# codebases source code is generated and passed to user-defined logic that turns the model into documentation.
